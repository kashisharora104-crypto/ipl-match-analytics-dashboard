# 🏏 IPL Match Analytics Dashboard — MI vs CSK

## Project Overview

I built this project to explore how data analytics can be used in live cricket match coverage. Using ball-by-ball IPL data from a Mumbai Indians vs Chennai Super Kings match, I created a Tableau dashboard to analyze score progression, batting contributions, and performance across different match phases.

The goal was not just to visualize numbers, but to turn match data into simple insights that could support commentary, storytelling, and fan understanding during a live game.

## What This Dashboard Shows

* Score progression across both innings
* Runs scored per over (momentum tracking)
* Performance across Powerplay, Middle, and Death overs
* Top batting contributions in the match
* Insight notes explaining key turning points

## Insights from the Match

* The pace of scoring increased significantly during the death overs
* One late over produced the biggest scoring burst of the match
* Middle overs saw the highest run leakage from the bowling side
* The top batter anchored the innings and contributed a large portion of total runs
* Score progression reflected different batting strategies from both teams
  
## Why I Built This

I’m interested in sports analytics and wanted to understand how match data can support real-time analysis, commentary, and storytelling. This project helped me see how raw numbers can be converted into meaningful insights for viewers and analysts.

## Tools Used

* Python (Pandas) — data cleaning and preparation
* Google Colab — analysis environment
* Tableau Public — dashboard and visualization

## Dashboard Components

1. Score progression comparison
2. Manhattan chart (runs per over)
3. Phase-wise performance analysis
4. Top batting contributions
5. Insight annotations based on match data

## Learning Outcomes

* Practiced working with ball-by-ball sports data
* Learned how to translate data into simple visual stories
* Improved dashboard design and visualization skills
* Understood how analytics can support sports media and match coverage
